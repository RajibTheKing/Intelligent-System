Analyze Cosinus distance of 0:



Time Series 1: 3 2 4 -2
Time Series 2: -2 3 1 2


Cosine Distance = -6 + 6 + 4 - 4  = 0


Time Series 1: 1 5   6 4
Time Series 2: 5 -1  2 -3



Cosine Distance = 5 - 5 + 12 - 12




Analyze  DTW Path:


Time Series 1: 0 2 -3 4 0 1 1
Time Series 2: 0 0 2 -3 5 0 1
