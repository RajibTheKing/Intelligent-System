What is the difference between Numpy and Panda?

Numpy:
--------
NumPy is a Python package which stands for ‘Numerical Python’. 
It is the core library for scientific computing, which contains a powerful n-dimensional array object.
Provide tools for integrating C, C++ etc. It is also useful in linear algebra, random number capability etc. 
NumPy array can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container for generic data.

Panda:
-------

Pandas is one of the most widely used python libraries in data science. 
It provides high-performance, easy to use structures and data analysis tools.
Unlike NumPy library which provides objects for multi-dimensional arrays, Pandas provides 
in-memory 2d table object called Dataframe. It is like a spreadsheet with column names and row labels.

Hence, with 2d tables, pandas is capable of providing many additional 
functionalities like creating pivot tables, computing columns based on other columns and plotting graphs.
