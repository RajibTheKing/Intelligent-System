Q1: What is the idea of Shape Definition Language(SDL)? 
A1: The most important information of a Time Series data can be extracted from a rough shape, which is actually limited terms of the Shape Definition Language enough to model it.
    These represent the different slopes of the time series. Advantageously, the representation can easily be processed by algorithms for symbolic sequences, like Longest Common Subsequence (LCSS).



Some important Terms:

PAA     -> Piecewise Aggregate Approximation
           PAA Segment Length = (Tend - Tstart)/ #Segments

PLA     -> Piecewise Linear Approximation

RLE     -> Run Length Encoding
APAA    -> Adaptive Piecewise Aggregate Approximation
PCA     -> Principal Component Analysis


Q2: What are the advantages and disadvantages in clipping algorithm? 
A2:
Advantages:
     Extreme compression rate (float -> bool)
     Simple representation (only binary values)
     Rough patterns can be found easily
Disatvantage:
     Very unprecise representation of the signal
